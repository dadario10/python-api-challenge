  - Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
  - Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
  - Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  - Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  - Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 
  - Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  - Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

 - Part 2: VacationPy
  - A map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
  - Narrowed down the city_data_df DataFrame to find my ideal weather conditions
  - Used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of my narrowed DataFrame
  - Added the hotel names and the countries as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map
